                <div class="sub-title-content">
                    <p>Born in San Antonio, Texas, I moved to and mainly have lived in Marietta, Georgia. 
                    I studied at Walton High School, surrounded by competitiveness and discipline. 
                    As a high-achieving academic student, I also have many interests outside of school including computer 
                    science, music, and tennis. With my father a computer science professor and my mother a piano teacher, 
                    I have experienced the best of both worlds.

                        <li><span>Computer Science</span><br>‣ I have always been interested in coding from an early age. I was taught
                        Python with tutors and professors while practicing the language by myseslf. Additionally, my father is a 
                        computer science professor at KSU. I have tried to explore different fields in coding, such as robotics, website 
                        development, and project programming. In my freshman year of high school,
                        I took AP Computer Science Principles online; subsequently, I took AP Computer Science A in person in my 
                        sophomore year, learning Java for the first time. In my eyes, coding gives me pleasure as it forces me to
                        think critcally about existing and potential problems, and it is satisfying to see my code successful execute.</li>

                        <li><span>Music</span><br>‣ I come from an extensive background of music as my family can all relate to it.
                        My mother is an experienced piano teacher, my father loves to practice guitar in his freetime, and
                        my sister is currently majoring in violin at the Mannes School of Music. I have played cello since I was seven
                        years old. Cello is not just a hobby to me but a passion. Not only do I enjoy the exhilarating while nervous 
                        feeling when I step on concert stages to perform and compete, but simply practicing to strive for growth within 
                        my musical journey is as enjoyable as well. I find working with other musicians, whether in an orchestra or in 
                        chamber music, to be relatable, because they too understand the struggles and feats when playing music.</li>

                        enjoy the sport, winning many tournaments at an early age. Although I was not very 
                        fond of actively moving around on the court, the exhileration that came from striking the ball washed away all the 
                        pain. Practicing multiple days a week, I soon rose up the ranks, achieving a ranking in the top 20 of the state of 
                        Georgia. I now occasionally play tournaments on the weekends and am an active player on my school's varsity team.</li>
